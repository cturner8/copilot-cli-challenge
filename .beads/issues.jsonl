{"id":"bm-gui","title":"Migrate from mattn/go-sqlite3 to modernc.org/sqlite to eliminate CGO","description":"## Summary\n\nReplace `mattn/go-sqlite3` (CGO-based) with `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go) to eliminate the CGO dependency and simplify cross-platform builds.\n\n## Background\n\nThe release workflow (GitHub Actions) currently fails when building for macOS targets because `mattn/go-sqlite3` requires CGO, which in turn requires Zig as a cross-compiler. Zig cannot resolve `libresolv` during macOS cross-compilation from a Linux runner (see [ziglang/zig#16674](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/16674)).\n\nA workaround exists (`CGO_LDFLAGS=-Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup`), but it disables linker safety checks for the entire binary. This approach is fragile, unproven at scale, and no major Go projects ship `mattn/go-sqlite3` with Zig cross-compilation to macOS/Windows.\n\n## Scope\n\n### Go Code Changes\n- Replace `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` with `modernc.org/sqlite` in `go.mod`\n- Update the driver import in `internal/database/connection.go` from `_ \"github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3\"` to `_ \"modernc.org/sqlite\"`\n- Update `sql.Open(\"sqlite3\", ...)` to use the modernc driver name if different\n- Run all existing database tests to verify compatibility\n\n### GoReleaser Changes (`.goreleaser.yml`)\n- Remove `CGO_ENABLED=1` from build env\n- Remove all platform-specific `overrides` (Zig CC targets, CGO_LDFLAGS)\n\n### CI/CD Changes (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)\n- Remove the `Install cross-compilation tools` step (Zig installation)\n\n### Testing\n- Verify all existing database tests pass (`go test ./internal/database/...`)\n- Verify full test suite passes (`go test ./...`)\n- Verify GoReleaser snapshot build succeeds locally (`goreleaser build --snapshot --clean`)\n- Test the built binary on macOS and Windows if possible\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] `modernc.org/sqlite` replaces `mattn/go-sqlite3` as the SQLite driver\n- [ ] CGO is no longer required for any build target\n- [ ] Zig is no longer required in the CI/CD pipeline\n- [ ] All existing tests pass\n- [ ] Release workflow builds successfully for all 6 targets (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64)\n- [ ] No `CGO_LDFLAGS` workarounds in the GoReleaser config\n\n## Risks\n- **Performance**: `modernc.org/sqlite` is ~2x slower on inserts and 10-100% slower on queries vs `mattn/go-sqlite3`. This is negligible for binmate's use case (small CRUD operations for tracking installed binaries).\n- **Compatibility**: `modernc.org/sqlite` passes most but not all SQLite test suite cases. Edge-case bugs are possible but unlikely for standard operations.\n- **API differences**: The `database/sql` interface is the same; only the driver import and registration name may differ.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"17177161+cturner8@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-10T19:05:33.579252053Z","created_by":"cameron turner","updated_at":"2026-02-10T19:57:51.008149175Z","closed_at":"2026-02-10T19:57:51.008149175Z","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["cicd"]}
