{"id":"bm-01p","title":"Consider optimisation of binary storage to minimise storage space for non-active versions","description":"# bm-01p Implementation Plan\n\n## Problem summary\n`binmate` currently keeps extracted binaries for every installed version under `~/.local/share/binmate/versions/\u003cbinary\u003e/\u003cversion\u003e/...`, which can consume significant disk space.  \nFor bm-01p, we will move to **archive-only storage for non-active versions**, keeping only the active version extracted and re-extracting on switch.\n\n## Current state analysis\n- `internal/core/install/service.go` always downloads + extracts during install, then stores `installations.installed_path` as the extracted binary path.\n- `internal/core/version/service.go` switches by symlinking to `installation.InstalledPath` and assumes the target exists.\n- `internal/providers/github/download_asset.go` saves archives in cache (`os.UserCacheDir()/binmate/...`) but this cache is not integrated into install/switch workflows.\n- `downloads` table/repository exists (`internal/database/schema.go`, `internal/database/repository/downloads.go`) but is currently unused by core install/switch logic.\n- Remove flow (`internal/core/binary/service.go`) deletes installation paths, but does not manage archive cache records/files.\n\n## Confirmed behavioural decisions\n- ✅ Non-active versions should be archive-only.\n- ✅ On every install/switch, keep exactly one extracted version (the active one).\n- ✅ If archive cache is missing during switch, automatically re-download from GitHub.\n\n## Workplan\n- [ ] Add a storage orchestration layer for version materialisation.\n  - [ ] Introduce helper(s) to: locate active/inactive installations, ensure archive availability, extract a target version, and clean extracted files of inactive versions.\n  - [ ] Reuse existing extraction functions (`ExtractAsset`) and avoid duplicate extraction logic.\n- [ ] Wire install flow to persist archive metadata and enforce single extracted active version.\n  - [ ] After successful download, upsert/create `downloads` record with cache path for `(binary_id, version)`.\n  - [ ] Keep installed version extracted and set active symlink as today.\n  - [ ] Remove extracted files for all other installed versions (preserving DB records and archives).\n  - [ ] Ensure `installations.installed_path` is updated if extraction location changes during rematerialisation.\n- [ ] Wire switch flow to extract on demand before symlink update.\n  - [ ] On switch, verify `installation.InstalledPath` exists.\n  - [ ] If missing, restore from cached archive; if archive missing, fetch release asset + download, then extract.\n  - [ ] Update installation record path/checksum/size metadata if rematerialised output differs.\n  - [ ] Set active symlink and prune extracted files for all now-inactive versions.\n- [ ] Add repository support needed for safe metadata updates.\n  - [ ] Add/update methods for installation path and metadata updates (minimal SQL changes).\n  - [ ] Add helper for download lookup/create-or-update by `(binary_id, version)` if needed.\n- [ ] Extend tests for new behaviour.\n  - [ ] Unit tests for “switch rematerialises missing extracted binary”.\n  - [ ] Unit tests for “install prunes inactive extracted versions”.\n  - [ ] Unit tests for “switch re-downloads when archive missing”.\n  - [ ] Regression checks for symlink correctness and non-circular targets.\n- [ ] Update user-facing docs/help where storage semantics are described (README and/or relevant command docs) to explain archive-only inactive versions.\n- [ ] Validate quality gates.\n  - [ ] Run `go test ./...` and ensure touched packages pass.\n  - [ ] Run `go fmt` on changed Go files.\n\n## Notes and considerations\n- Keep changes surgical: reuse existing DB tables (`downloads`) and service boundaries before adding new schema.\n- Preserve current CLI UX and command contracts (`install`, `switch`, `versions`, `remove`).\n- Ensure failures are explicit (no silent fallbacks), especially around missing archives and download/extraction errors.\n- Prefer deterministic cache-path handling to avoid archive filename collisions across binaries/providers.\n","notes":"Implementation plan captured for bm-01p (archive-only inactive versions):\n\nProblem:\n- Installed versions currently remain extracted under ~/.local/share/binmate/versions/\u003cbinary\u003e/\u003cversion\u003e, causing avoidable storage growth.\n\nConfirmed behaviour:\n- Non-active versions should be archive-only.\n- Keep exactly one extracted version (the active one) after install/switch.\n- If archive is missing when switching, automatically re-download from GitHub.\n\nPlanned work:\n1) Add storage orchestration for materialisation/pruning of versions.\n2) Wire install flow to persist archive metadata in downloads and prune inactive extracted files.\n3) Wire switch flow to rematerialise missing extracted binaries from cache, with re-download fallback.\n4) Add minimal repository support for safe metadata/path updates where needed.\n5) Add tests for rematerialisation, pruning, and re-download fallback.\n6) Update user-facing docs describing archive-only inactive versions.\n7) Run gofmt and full go test validation.\n\nNotes:\n- Reuse existing downloads table/repository and extraction flow.\n- Preserve current CLI UX/contracts for install/switch/versions/remove.\n- Keep errors explicit (no silent fallback).","status":"in_progress","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-08T16:59:29.604067001Z","updated_at":"2026-02-14T11:44:46.446442967Z","labels":["enhancement"]}

{"id":"bm-gui","title":"Migrate from mattn/go-sqlite3 to modernc.org/sqlite to eliminate CGO","description":"## Summary\n\nReplace `mattn/go-sqlite3` (CGO-based) with `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go) to eliminate the CGO dependency and simplify cross-platform builds.\n\n## Background\n\nThe release workflow (GitHub Actions) currently fails when building for macOS targets because `mattn/go-sqlite3` requires CGO, which in turn requires Zig as a cross-compiler. Zig cannot resolve `libresolv` during macOS cross-compilation from a Linux runner (see [ziglang/zig#16674](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/16674)).\n\nA workaround exists (`CGO_LDFLAGS=-Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup`), but it disables linker safety checks for the entire binary. This approach is fragile, unproven at scale, and no major Go projects ship `mattn/go-sqlite3` with Zig cross-compilation to macOS/Windows.\n\n## Scope\n\n### Go Code Changes\n- Replace `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3` with `modernc.org/sqlite` in `go.mod`\n- Update the driver import in `internal/database/connection.go` from `_ \"github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3\"` to `_ \"modernc.org/sqlite\"`\n- Update `sql.Open(\"sqlite3\", ...)` to use the modernc driver name if different\n- Run all existing database tests to verify compatibility\n\n### GoReleaser Changes (`.goreleaser.yml`)\n- Remove `CGO_ENABLED=1` from build env\n- Remove all platform-specific `overrides` (Zig CC targets, CGO_LDFLAGS)\n\n### CI/CD Changes (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)\n- Remove the `Install cross-compilation tools` step (Zig installation)\n\n### Testing\n- Verify all existing database tests pass (`go test ./internal/database/...`)\n- Verify full test suite passes (`go test ./...`)\n- Verify GoReleaser snapshot build succeeds locally (`goreleaser build --snapshot --clean`)\n- Test the built binary on macOS and Windows if possible\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] `modernc.org/sqlite` replaces `mattn/go-sqlite3` as the SQLite driver\n- [ ] CGO is no longer required for any build target\n- [ ] Zig is no longer required in the CI/CD pipeline\n- [ ] All existing tests pass\n- [ ] Release workflow builds successfully for all 6 targets (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64)\n- [ ] No `CGO_LDFLAGS` workarounds in the GoReleaser config\n\n## Risks\n- **Performance**: `modernc.org/sqlite` is ~2x slower on inserts and 10-100% slower on queries vs `mattn/go-sqlite3`. This is negligible for binmate's use case (small CRUD operations for tracking installed binaries).\n- **Compatibility**: `modernc.org/sqlite` passes most but not all SQLite test suite cases. Edge-case bugs are possible but unlikely for standard operations.\n- **API differences**: The `database/sql` interface is the same; only the driver import and registration name may differ.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"17177161+cturner8@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-10T19:05:33.579252053Z","created_by":"cameron turner","updated_at":"2026-02-10T19:57:51.008149175Z","closed_at":"2026-02-10T19:57:51.008149175Z","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["cicd"]}
